    Here I want to apply for a job of web development engineer because I am professional and experienced in Java web development. I have a lot of project development experience.For example, in 2017, I developed an android application to provide garbage truck reservation service for users. And in 2018, I developed a WeChat applet for Guangzhou South Railway Station. And recently, as a leader, I developed a commercial website with my team.
